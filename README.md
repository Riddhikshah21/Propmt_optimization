# Propmt_optimization
Build a machine learning model to optimize prompts and suggest the best-performing ones for a given context.

The system will require:
- A dataset of prompts and their outputs (quality scores).
- A model to evaluate prompt effectiveness based on some metric (e.g., relevance, coherence).
- A way to iterate and refine prompts until you achieve optimal results.
